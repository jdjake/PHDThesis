For any bounded, regulated function $a: [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{C}$, consider the family of operators $\{ T_R \}$ on the sphere $S^d$ such that $T_R f = a(k/R) f$ for any spherical harmonic $f$ of degree $k$. This thesis discusses the work of the author on characterizing the functions $a$ for which the operators $\{ T_R \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$ in the range $1/(d-1) < |1/p - 1/2| < 1/2$. More generally, we obtain analogous results in the more general setting of multiplier operators for eigenfunction expansions of an elliptic pseudodifferential operator $P$ on a compact manifold $X$, under curvature assumptions on the principal symbol of $P$, and assuming the eigenvalues of $P$ are contained in an arithmetic progression, assuming that the function $a$ defining the eigenfunction expansion is compactly supported.

One consequence of our result are new transference principles controlling the $L^p$ boundedness of the multiplier operators associated with a function $a$, in terms of the $L^p$ operator norm of the radial Fourier multiplier operator on $\RR^d$ with symbol $a(|\cdot|): \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{C}$, the first nontrivial result of it's kind. The latter results have been published in \cite{Denson}, and the former results have yet to be described elsewhere. In order to prove these results, we obtain new quasi-orthogonality estimates for averages of solutions to the half-wave equation $\partial_t - i P = 0$, via a connection between pseudodifferential operators satisfying an appropriate curvature condition and Finsler geometry, as well as utilizing atomic decompositions on manifolds.

In Part I of the thesis, we review prior work on endpoint bounds relevant to the new results stated, in particular, endpoint bounds for radial and quasi-radial Fourier multiplier operators on Euclidean space, as well as Finsler geometry and Fourier integral operators on compact manifolds. In Part II, we prove the results stated above.
