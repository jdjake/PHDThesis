Let $P$ be an elliptic linear operator on a compact manifold $M$, such that we can associate a functional calculus $a \mapsto a(P)$ for functions $a$ on the real line. In this thesis, we study the following question:  
%
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}{2cm}
\begin{center}
  \emph{What conditions on $a$ guarantee an operator $a(P)$ to be bounded.}
\end{center}
\end{changemargin}
%
Aside from testing our ability to understand the operator $P$ and the relations of it's eigenfunctions, the question has applications in the study of various partial differential equations associated with the operator $P$, and is closely related to the geometry of $M$, in particular, the way waves propagate and interact on the manifold.

Moreover, the study of multipliers on a manifold provides a useful setting with which to test and develop methods of harmonic analysis in a `variable-coefficient setting', where a lack of symmetry and translation invariance forces us to introduce more robust methods than are required in the Euclidean setting, i.e. as compared to studying multipliers of the Laplace operator on $\RR^d$ using the Fourier transform.

At present, there are many obstacles related to the global geometry of manifolds, which prevent an understanding of spectral multiplier operators on a general manifold. Over the years, sufficient conditions for boundedness had been established, but no characterizations of boundedness were known on any compact manifold, aside from the translation invariant setting which occurs when studying the Laplace operator on the torus. This thesis describes the first such characterizations beyond this setting, for a limited range of Lebesgue spaces, and on manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed and have commensurable length. In particular, we find characterizations of functions $a$ whose dilates induce uniformly bounded multiplier operators for spherical harmonic expansions on $S^d$. We obtain these results by expanding on techniques for understanding Fourier integral operators on manifolds.

In Chapter \ref{cha:multipliers_of_an_elliptic_operator}, we describe the setup to problem we are to discuss in more detail. In Chapter \ref{sec:radmult}, we discuss results known for radial and quasi-radial multipliers which are analogue to the endpoint bounds we will establish for spectral multipliers on manifolds. In Chapter \ref{chap:waveequation}, we return to the study of spectral multipliers on manifolds, introducing the background on Finsler geometry and Fourier integral operators we will need in the proofs to come. In Chapter \ref{chap:boundedsinglefrequencyscale}, we discuss our new results for spectral multipliers with a compactly supported symbol, and in Chapter \ref{chap:spectralatomicdchapter}, we discuss new results about combining different frequency scales to bound more general spectral multiplier operators.
