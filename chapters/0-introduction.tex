Let $P$ be an elliptic linear operator on a compact manifold $M$, such that we can associate a functional calculus $a \mapsto a(P)$ for functions $a$ on the real line. In this thesis, we study the following question:  
%
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}{2cm}
\begin{center}
  \emph{What conditions on $a$ are necessary and sufficient for the operator $a(P)$ to be bounded.}
\end{center}
\end{changemargin}
%
Aside from testing our ability to understand the operator $P$ and the relations of it's eigenfunctions, the question has applications in the study of various partial differential equations associated with the operator $P$, and is closely related to the geometry of $M$, in particular, the way waves propogate and interact on the manifold.

Moreover, the study of multipliers on a manifold provides a useful setting with which to test and develop methods of harmonic analysis in a `variable-coefficient setting', where a lack of symmetry and translation invariance forces us to introduce more robust methods than are required in the Euclidean setting, i.e. as compared to studying multipliers of the translation-invariant Laplace operator $\Delta$ on $\RR^d$ using the Fourier transform.

At present, there are many obstacles related to the global geometry of manifolds, which prevent an understanding of spectral multiplier operators on a general manifold. Before the results discussed in this thesis, sufficient conditions for boundedness had been established, but no necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness of multipliers were known on any compact manifold, aside from the translation-invariant case where $M = \TT^d$. Some results are obtained for general manifolds in this thesis, but our current inability to understand the large-time behaviour of the wave equation to a suitable degree on a general manifold means we must restrict our attention to manifolds whose geodesics are all closed, and have the same length. For a limited range of exponents, we obtain efficient estimates for multipliers on such manifolds. In particular, on the sphere $S^d$, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for multiplier operators of spherical harmonic expansions to bounded on $L^p(S^d)$.

We obtain these results by expanding on techniques in the theory of Fourier integral operators. In Chapter TODO, we discuss the general theory of Fourier integral operators, as well as a discussion of the best results currently known for multipliers of the Laplacian $\Delta$ on $\RR^d$, which can also be described as \emph{radial Fourier multipliers on Euclidean Space}. In Chapter TODO, we give an exposition of methods more closely associated with the problem. Chapters TODO and TODO discuss our main contribution to the problem (TODO More Here). Chapter TODO discusses methods we hope to develop in the future.
